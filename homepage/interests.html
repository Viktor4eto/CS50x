                    <p>
                        I love programming! I have always liked electronics
                        and gandgets and eventually this turned into a passion for making stuff.
                        I also like solving problems so in a way programming combined my love for electronics
                        with my love for solving problems and created one of my numerous interests.

                    <p>
                        Math has always been a passion of mine. There is just something special about
                        solving problems, equations, finding solutions and logic. It fascinates me to
                        this day how things can be presented with symbols and numbers and those things have meaning and power within.

                    <p>
                        There is something very exciting about talking in front of so much people. The
                        adrenaline rush, the stage fright - everything. And yet, the best moment is when you are
                        off the stage and it is all behind you. It makes me feel like a new person - reborn from that excitement.
